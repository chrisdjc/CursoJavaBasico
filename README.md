# Curso 4 
## _Introducci√≥n a Java SE_

The next files contain examples of basic and general topics about programming, like the data types, loops, functions, essentially the indispensable information when starting to code, but in this project we specifically used java to demostrate how we can use and code given the examples on the platzi course

## Features

- DataTypesJava: using different data to show the usage of each one
- FamilyCanCastillo: challenge where we use what we learned to print out our familys' info
- Hola Mundo: many files, gruoped by topics, illustrating how to declare variables, constans, arrays, where and how work the loops, mathematic and logical operations.

## Tech

There only languaged used is

- [java] - all the files are coded in java

## Extra:
- [JDK 1.8] 
- [JDK 11]
- 
Switching versions to demostrate when our code runs, and when it doesn't 

The project was based on the Platzi course:
